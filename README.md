# Formats

This is my latex template preamble. Pairing with [MyLatex](https://github.com/kwang0913/MyLatex/tree/main/Example) can reproduce the template.

- This has been fully tested on Linux and Win. Woring around Linux is much easier. Working with Win requires extra care in package order. I have fixed what I encountered.
- One problem with Win is that Miktex doesn't install all packages (it only installs needed packages). This is good to save disk space but will violate many package default value. For instance, install __cm-super__ before using this template.
